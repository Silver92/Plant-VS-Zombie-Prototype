* The object of the game is to stop animals from entering your house.

* Animals come in randomly from the right.

* Animals are limited to one of five horizontal lanes.

* The player can place defenses in any of the lanes in the gardenDefense placement is limited to one of nine columns, only one per square at a time.
* Defense types include projectiles, and blockers.
* When a projectile hits an animal it takes damage.
* When an animal hits a plant or blocker, it starts damaging it.
* When animals take a finite amount of damage, they disappear.
* Animals do not collide with each other.
* Projectiles do not collide with defenses or other projectiles.
* When an animal reaches a defense it stops and deals damage.
* When the defense has taken sufficient damage, it dies and disappears from the scene.
* Animals start walking again once the defense disappears.
* Defenses can be placed only when you have collected enough credits.
* You collect credits by placing a special type of collector plant which is defenseless.
* There are 2 types of animals (e.g. standard, jumping) and 4 types of defenses (e.g. sun producer, cactus)
